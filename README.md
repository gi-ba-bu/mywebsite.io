   <p> Hello, my name is Giacomo. I'm trying my very best. </p> 

    <p> I am currently training as a full stack web developer with FutureProof. That's how I learnt to build this website. </p>

    Prior to this, I earned a PhD in applied mathematics from the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds (2021). In my research, I was interested in analytical modelling of complex systems. To view my thesis, follow this

    During my PhD, I also presented my work at international conferences:<Text style={{color: 'blue'}} onPress={() => Linking.openURL('https://twitter.com/l19eeds/status/1146074015548792832')}> here</Text> is a Twitter-documented example.

    <p>I have also completed some interesting hands-on data science and machine learning projects, including:  </p>
    <p className='bullet'> Preventing Food Waste by Building a Forecasting Model to Predict Sales of Fresh Food.  </p>
    <p className='bullet'> Automated Assessment of Vascular Perfusion.  </p>
    <p className='bullet'> Exploring and quantifying the effect of weather on sales.  </p>

    <p> Finally, I am a qualified secondary school maths teacher in the UK and taught mathematics in state schools.</p>
